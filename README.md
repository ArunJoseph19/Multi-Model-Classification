# Multi-Model-Classification
Project #1

A few days ago, I saw a meme on Instagram. The meme was a bunch of similar looking images arranged in a matrix. I thought it would be a nice little project, if I could train a simple CNN model to predict each images.
Above that, I train a Main model which has the ability to predict with class each images belongs to.

<b>Working:</b> 
1. Image is fed
2. Main model predicts which class it belong to, out of 8 classes:<br>
  a. Chihuahua V Muffin<br>
  b. Kitten V Ice Cream<br>
  c. Labradoodle V Fried Chicken<br>
  d. Parrot V Guacamole<br>
  e. Puppy V Bagel<br>
  f. Sheepdog V Mop<br>
  g. Shiva Inu V Marshmallow<br>
  h. Sloth V Croissant<br>
3. Then, individually trained models, classifies it in binary.
4. Class and label is printed, along with the image.
