# Multi-Model-Classification
Project #1

A few days ago, I saw a meme on Instagram. The meme was a bunch of similar looking images arranged in a matrix. I thought it would be a nice little project, if I could train a simple CNN model to predict each images.
Above that, I train a Main model which has the ability to predict with class each images belongs to.

<b>Working:</b> 
1. Image is fed
2. Main model predicts which class it belong to, out of 8 classes:<br>
  a. Chihuahua V Muffin<br>
  b. Kitten V Ice Cream<br>
  c. Labradoodle V Fried Chicken<br>
  d. Parrot V Guacamole<br>
  e. Puppy V Bagel<br>
  f. Sheepdog V Mop<br>
  g. Shiva Inu V Marshmallow<br>
  h. Sloth V Croissant<br>
3. Then, individually trained models, classifies it in binary.
4. Class and label is printed, along with the image.

Full Disclosure, the model is pretty bad....given the very few images available to train.
But overall, it works amazingly.
